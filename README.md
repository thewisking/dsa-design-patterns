# dsa-design-patterns

A collection of implementations of classic **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **design patterns**.

Right now this is a work-in-progress learning repo. As I implement things, I’ll document them here.

---

## Goals

- Build a solid foundation in core data structures and algorithms.
- Practise clean, readable implementations.
- Demonstrate common object-oriented design patterns with small, focused examples.
- Track my progress over time.

---

## Repository structure

> This will evolve as I add more code.

- `data-structures/` – implementations of core data structures.
- `algorithms/` – sorting, searching, graph algorithms, DP, etc.
- `design-patterns/` – examples of GoF and other patterns.
- `docs/` _(optional)_ – notes, diagrams, and explanations.

---

## How to use this repo

- Browse the folders to see what’s currently implemented.
- Read the code and comments.
- Run the examples locally and experiment with changes.

> I’ll add language-specific setup and run instructions once there’s actual code.
